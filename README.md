# trans
Firefox plugin for Oracle CPQ cloud developers

Extension is used to copy transaction ID of a quote/transaction and to get the XML of the transaction. Please use the refresh button before copying the transaction ID or accessing the XML file, this is to make sure that the dev uses the current quote transaction ID or XML, when there are multiple quotes opened.  

Note: To pull XML code of a quote, the respective commerce process should have atleast one Printer Friendly/History XSL View.
